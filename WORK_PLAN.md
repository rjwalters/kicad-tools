## Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold Pileup

Judge-approved PRs under a hold (`loom:blocked` or `loom:operator`) — only a human merge decision is missing.

_None._

## Very Important

`loom:very-important` (one counts per workspace); every stage takes these first.

_None._

## Important

`loom:important`; taken before unlabelled work.

- **#6858**: router: coupled pre-pass should keep the better of the joint-search and pose-centreline candidates (compare-and-keep; unblocks #6835)
- **#7093**: router: differential pair gets unequal via counts when a leg falls back to uncoupled routing (board 03 USB_D 2 vs 3; blocks #6394)
- **#7269**: board 07 MIPI_DAT0: recover 0.038 mm skew lost to compare-and-keep (blocks #6858)
- **#7401**: router: board 06 USB2_D+ uncoupled 12.791 > 12.700 mm after v62 pad-edge floor reorders the single-ended fallback

## Ready

Human-approved issues ready for implementation (`loom:issue`).

_None._

## In Progress

Issues currently being built (`loom:building`).

- **#6554**: diffpair: reproduce KiCad's diff_pair_uncoupled primitive pairing exactly (kct is a lower bound)
- **#7084**: router: routing board 03 under jlcpcb-tier1 collapses the USB_D In2.Cu common run to 1.4 mm (arm C under jlcpcb keeps 4.1 mm)
- **#7093**: router: differential pair gets unequal via counts when a leg falls back to uncoupled routing (board 03 USB_D 2 vs 3; blocks #6394)
- **#7204**: DFA false-PASS: courtyard check silently skips courtyard-less footprints (boards 00/01/04 signed off with 0 courtyards) and AssemblyCapabilities is never enforced (board 07 double-sided CPL unflagged)
- **#7269**: board 07 MIPI_DAT0: recover 0.038 mm skew lost to compare-and-keep (blocks #6858)
- **#7296**: Router: refuse pad-edge vias (mask-dam floor) and move existing ones on boards 02/05/06 (split from #7220, PR3)
- **#7349**: Boards 06/07: enable diff-pair gap tightening on seed-42 re-routes and drop the impedance caps (#7344 PR 2)
- **#7399**: Schematic blocks: 10 stock factories fail on real KiCad 10 libs (stale symbol IDs, fictional mock pins); add a real-symbol smoke test
- **#7410**: Gate regenerate_boards_03_04_6076.py's board-03 readiness.json promotion (#7358 allowlist)
- **#7423**: Board 07: enable route-time length matching in the committed map after #7397 (no-worse re-measure; #5798 Q4 ruling)
- **#7433**: JLCPCB CPL exports THT pin headers at pin 1 instead of body centre (~8.9 mm off on 1x8); affects boards 02-07 THT rows
- **#7435**: refresh_readiness: board 04 has no drc_targets, so nothing re-pins its native-drc.json

## PRs Awaiting Review

PRs waiting on Judge (`loom:review-requested`).

- **#7428**: fix(blocks): wire OpAmpBlock and multi-channel ESD array to real pins
- **#7438**: refactor(boards): run board 03 readiness receipt in-process via readiness_cmd.main
- **#7443**: feat: show per-run decline reasons in gap tightening and refresh board 07 sidecar

## Approved (Awaiting Merge)

PRs that passed review and are queued for Champion auto-merge (`loom:pr`).

_None._

- **#6448**: [Epic #6441] Phase 6: unify diff-pair engines — grid consumes PairPlan or grid coupled pre-pass retired *(architect)*
- **#7206**: Spec-declared currents never reach the ampacity gate: board 05 motor phase necked to 0.2 mm passes check, audit and readiness *(hermit)*
- **#7367**: Key remaining count-based CI/test allowances by identity (extends #7359): stale board-03/07 allowances, board-05 blocking cap, DRC tolerance counts *(hermit)*
- **#7377**: route: collapse the 4 copy-pasted post-route tails into one pipeline -- --length-match-diffpairs, --stitch-power-planes, --progressive-clearance, --bus-routing silently no-op on the default --auto-layers path *(hermit)*
- **#7399**: Schematic blocks: 10 stock factories fail on real KiCad 10 libs (stale symbol IDs, fictional mock pins); add a real-symbol smoke test *(hermit)*

## Epics

- **#3438**: router: board 07 stuck at 28/31 — negotiated router cannot complete parallel pad-array bundles (DDR bundle ALONE routes 9/11)
- **#4410**: board-05: generator must produce a manufacturable BLDC board unattended (81% route, 7 ISENSE/PWM open, 2 real shorts)
- **#4431**: route: per-net scalar clearance cannot express HV isolation — need class-pair (net-class × net-class) clearance rules in the router; both workarounds proven inadequate on a mains board
- **#5508**: Epic: pad-access invariant — no committed route may strand an unrouted pad
- **#5509**: Epic: one clearance kernel — search, commit, and final validation must agree with kicad-cli DRC
- **#5784**: Epic: adopt measured KiCadRoutingTools techniques (oracle completion, pose diff-pair search, N+1 rip-up)
- **#5952**: Epic: Harness-neutral kicad-tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI, opencode)
- **#6441**: Epic: diff-pair routing redesign — gateways, via pairs, uncoupled budget, per-segment rules
