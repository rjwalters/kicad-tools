## Routing performance: build the C++ backend first

Before benchmarking routing latency or filing "router is slow" issues,
verify the C++ router extension (`src/kicad_tools/router/router_cpp.*.so`)
is built in the active worktree:

```bash
uv run kct build-native --check
# Expected: "C++ backend: available (version 1.0.0)"
```

If it reports "not installed", build it once:

```bash
uv run kct build-native
```

`uv sync` does **not** build the native extension — fresh checkouts and
new git worktrees (`.loom/worktrees/issue-N/`) need this step explicitly.
The C++ backend gives a 10-100x speedup for the A* loop, so a missing
extension is the most likely cause of multi-minute-per-net routing.

### Rebuilding after editing C++ sources

`kct build-native` now detects staleness automatically: it compares the
newest mtime of `src/kicad_tools/router/cpp/**` (`.cpp`/`.hpp` and
`CMakeLists.txt`) against the installed `.so` and **rebuilds when the
source is newer**, even without a `BUILD_VERSION` bump. When the `.so` is
already up to date it prints `SKIPPED rebuild` instead of the old
misleading `installed successfully!`.

`--force` always recompiles regardless of mtimes — reach for it if you
suspect the auto-detection missed something (e.g. a touched build flag).

See `README.md` "Fresh worktree checklist" for the full setup sequence.
