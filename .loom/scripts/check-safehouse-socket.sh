# check-safehouse-socket.sh — one-shot, per-host safehouse-socket resolution
# report (issue #5523).
#
# Why: #5457 removed the only hardcoded `safehouse.socket` default — a path
# that had been committed to the SHARED `.loom/config.json` and stranded
# loom-worker-2 75 commits behind `git pull` (a correct fix). But nothing took
# its place as a *check*: `loom_mcp_safehouse_socket()`
# (defaults/scripts/lib/mcp-config.sh) has always silently returned an empty
# string when nothing resolves, and every caller's only signal was a
# `log_warn` buried inside that particular sweep's own log file. From the
# moment #5457 merged, every sweep on an affected host silently stopped
# narrating to safehouse — and the failure ran for 11 hours before a human
# noticed the public 2amlogic.com fleet pulse had gone stale, because nothing
# outside a sweep's own log was watching for it.
#
# This script is that "something watching": a standalone, on-demand check
# that reports — per managed repo, without reading a single sweep log —
# whether `safehouse.enabled` is set and, if so, whether a socket resolves
# AND is actually present on disk. It reuses the exact resolvers
# spawn-claude.sh / loom-daemon-start.sh already call
# (`defaults/scripts/lib/mcp-config.sh`), so "drift" here means exactly what
# it means to a spawning worker — no separate definition to keep in sync.
#
# Deliberately does NOT add a code-level conventional-path default to the
# resolver (see mcp-config.sh's `loom_mcp_safehouse_socket` header and
# defaults/docs/safehouse.md "Socket resolution" for the full writeup on
# why): the fix for "silence went unnoticed for 11 hours" is making the
# silence loud and cheap to check, independent of the daemon's own
# start/restart lifecycle — not guessing a path. The pre-existing static
# check in `loom-daemon-start.sh` (`print_safehouse_status`) only re-runs
# when the daemon itself (re)starts, which is exactly the case that let this
# incident run unnoticed on an already-running daemon; this script has no
# such dependency.
#
# Usage:
#   check-safehouse-socket.sh [--json] [REPO_ROOT ...]
#
#   With no REPO_ROOT arguments, checks every workspace registered in this
#   host's machine-level daemon registry (~/.loom/workspaces.json, or
#   $LOOM_WORKSPACES_PATH — see loom-daemon/src/workspace_registry.rs),
#   falling back to the enclosing repo of the current directory when the
#   registry is empty/absent/unreadable, so a lone interactive host still
#   gets a useful answer.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — every checked repo is either "not configured" (safehouse.enabled is
#       false/absent — a byte-for-byte no-op, see the degradation contract in
#       defaults/docs/safehouse.md) or "resolved" (a socket path resolved AND
#       is present on disk).
#   1 — at least one repo is "configured, enabled, unreachable": either
#       safehouse.enabled is true with no socket resolving at all (the exact
#       #5523 failure mode), or a socket path resolved but nothing exists
#       there yet (safehoused not running / not yet started).
#   2 — usage error (e.g. the sibling lib/mcp-config.sh is missing, a
#       stale/partial install).
