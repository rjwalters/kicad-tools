  trace_clearance:
    title: Minimum Trace Clearance
    spec_section: "Design Rules > Clearance"
    values:
      2_layer: 0.15mm  # 6 mil
      4_layer: 0.15mm  # 6 mil
    severity: error
    explanation: |
      OSH Park uses a 6 mil minimum clearance for all services.
      This is the edge-to-edge distance between copper features.
      Maintaining adequate clearance prevents shorts and improves yield.
    fix_templates:
      - "Increase spacing by at least {delta}mm to meet 6 mil minimum"
      - "Use design rule check with OSH Park rules enabled"

  trace_width:
    title: Minimum Trace Width
    spec_section: "Design Rules > Trace Width"
    values:
      2_layer: 0.15mm  # 6 mil
      4_layer: 0.127mm  # 5 mil
    severity: error
    explanation: |
      Minimum trace width is 6 mil (0.15mm) for 2-layer and 5 mil (0.127mm)
      for 4-layer boards. Thinner traces may not etch reliably and have
      lower current capacity.
    fix_templates:
      - "Increase trace width to at least {required}mm"
      - "For power traces, calculate width using IPC-2152"

  via_drill:
    title: Minimum Via Drill Size
    spec_section: "Design Rules > Drill Size"
    values:
      standard: 0.254mm  # 10 mil
    severity: error
    explanation: |
      OSH Park's minimum drill size is 10 mil (0.254mm). Smaller vias
      require their premium services with additional cost.
    fix_templates:
      - "Increase via drill size to at least {required}mm (10 mil)"
      - "Consider via-in-pad designs if space is constrained"
    related_rules:
      - via_annular_ring

  via_annular_ring:
    title: Minimum Via Annular Ring
    spec_section: "Design Rules > Annular Ring"
    values:
      standard: 0.127mm  # 5 mil
    severity: error
    explanation: |
      The copper ring around vias must be at least 5 mil (0.127mm).
      This ensures reliable connections even with drilling tolerances.
    fix_templates:
      - "Increase via pad size to achieve {required}mm annular ring"
      - "Via pad diameter should be drill + 2×annular ring"
    related_rules:

  edge_clearance:
    title: Minimum Copper to Board Edge
    spec_section: "Design Rules > Edge Clearance"
    values:
      standard: 0.381mm  # 15 mil
    severity: error
    explanation: |
      Copper features must be at least 15 mil (0.381mm) from the board
      edge. This prevents copper exposure during board routing.
    fix_templates:
      - "Move copper at least {required}mm from board edge"
      - "Draw board outline 15 mil inside your actual copper boundary"
