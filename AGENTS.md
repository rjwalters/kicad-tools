<!-- BEGIN LOOM ORCHESTRATION (AGENTS) -->
This repository uses [Loom](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom) for AI-powered development orchestration (dual-runtime: Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`; OpenAI Codex CLI and other AGENTS.md-aware runtimes read this file). See the Loom repository for the full guide (roles, labels, worktrees, configuration). When installed, Loom also writes a locally-substituted copy of the runtime-neutral guide to `.loom/AGENTS.md`.

## Squad — cross-agent collaboration

This repo has [Squad](https://github.com/rjwalters/squad) installed. Claude and
Codex share the same room and MCP tools. Before touching shared state, read
and follow the installed Squad skill, including its room/identity conventions:

- Claude: `.claude/skills/squad/SKILL.md`
- Codex: `.agents/skills/squad/SKILL.md` (invoke `$squad` or ask naturally)

Both expose join, goals, card, fanout, steward, and clear workflows. Claude aliases are
`/squad:<workflow>`; legacy Codex prompts are `/squad-<workflow>`.

For research work, discover and reuse the durable Science Card node IDs surfaced
by join/node list; the shared card workflow connects dependencies, committed
artifacts and revision-bound bank provenance.
